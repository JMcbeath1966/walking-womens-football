## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
<!--- review this whole section and original objective to ensure consistent testing user stories against original objectives - this needs much more work--->
### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.


    * Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable heading and navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text. <!--image under review> 

    * The main points are made in three sections underneath outlining the benefits of walking football. Under that is 6 clear sections on the venue and timings for the games/training.

    * The user has two options, click the sign up button or the call to action buttons <!--wording and style not decided YET-->, both of which will lead to the same place, to enable sign up at the earliest opportunity.

    * Social media icons are subtely placed to allow access to other media sites but not distract from the user experience of the website itself. Social media is at the bottom of the home page and all subsequent pages.

    

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.


    * The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top right of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.<!--Does the playing tab accurately describe the page! - Maybe GETTING STARTED would be better>
    * At the middle of the first pages there is a redirection call <!--TO BE ADDED UNDER THE SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS--> to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
    * On the Sign Up Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.


3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for  to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    * Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.

    * The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
    * At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the any changes.

    * These are clearly shown in the banner message <!--IS THIS RELEVANT WITHIN THE SIGN UP MESSAGE>
    * They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

    * The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page. <!--internal link to "Contact Us" page or change tab to sign up/contact us combined?-->
    * Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
    * The footer contains links to the clus social media as well as the organization's email.
    * Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.<!--TO BE ADDED-->                        .

3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find out about community links so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

    * In the Venue Page there are links (with brief organisational details) to help learn about the community groups available. 
    * The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
    * Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the any of the pages to find the Facebook Group <!-- is this needed given the scope of the project-->redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.

### Frequent User Goals

1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added training sessions or matches
    * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the fixtures.
<!---further thought required on the finish to frequent user goals--->

## Further Testing

* Predominantly female friends & family were used to test the website and to provide user experience feedback. 
* The website was tested on Mozilla, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer browsers
* Testing was carried out thoroughly on external/internal links to ensure they all opened to a new tab.
* The website was viewed on a variety of mobiles, laptop and desktops.
