### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the sport and how to play it.


    * Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable heading and navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with a sign up button, which when clicked is linked to the sign up page. The sign up page is also at in the navigation bar for users who want to access sign up immediately on opening the site.

    * The main points are made in the 'benefits of' sections underneath the sign up button outlining the benefits of walking football. Under that is 6 clear sections on the venue and timings for the games/training. There is a fixtures button on the last section to allow quick access to the fixtures page.

    * Social media icons are subtely placed to allow access to other media sites but not distract from the user experience of the website itself. Social media is at the bottom of the home page and all subsequent pages. There is also a contact email and address under the icons, which links to the site organiser email if enquiries are made.

    

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

    * The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top right of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
    * At the middle of the first pages there is a redirection sign up call to action and social media icons to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and feels the user can always access to other areas of the site as they scroll to the bottom of the page.


3. I want a First Time Visitor I want the menu bar to allow quick access to key information for sign up, playing the game and fixtures as results.

    * Therefore, as well as the information on the home page, there are three further pages with consistently styled and sized headers and footers to allow ease of navigation. 
    * The navigation bar is provided as a 'hamburger' menu on smaller screen sizes which provides a dropdown of the menu options under the navbar brand.
    * The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
    * At the bottom of the  section under the footer, with the an email for contact and an address for visitors

### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find future fixtures and results easily.

    * From the home page the Returning Visitor is able to access the fixtures page from the home page navigation bar.
    * The user can also click on the fixtures button in the section at the bottom of the home page, on the last section of the timings/age group section, just before the footer. The button will send them directly to the fixtures page

2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to use social media.

    * The social media icons on the footer link straight to websites which will allow them to access the clubs details.

### Frequent User Goals

1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added training sessions or matches
    * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the fixtures.

## Further Testing

* Predominantly female friends & family (4 girls and their friends) were used to test the website and to provide user experience feedback. My son who is also learning to code also provided feedback on the website. 
* The website was tested on Mozilla, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer browsers
* Testing was carried out thoroughly on external/internal links to ensure they all opened to a new tab.
* The website was viewed on a variety of mobiles, laptop and desktops.
* My mentor also provided valued feedback on the project.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

### Code
* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* Bootstrap4: Bootstrap Library used throughout the project to make site responsive using the Bootstrap Grid System.

### Content

* Hamburger menu code in index.html page is taken from [MDBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/)

* Form section in signup.html page is predominantly source code taken from the Love Running project in the Code Institure programme.

* Code snippet added from [Perishablepress.com](https://perishablepress.com/css-center-align-list-left-align-text/) that provides centering text for the div but aligning the bullet points to the left of an inline block.  

* Stack overflow was used to help provide a solution to changing the color of the navbar to match the color scheme of the webstie. I had struggled to find a solution and using stack overflow, it helped me realise I was working on a display element and therefore my CSS was not working as envisaged. My solution was to target the .navbar-light .navbar-toggler-icon image and amend the RGBA values to get the required color.

* Stack overflow was also used to correct an issue caused by placing an h3 header inside a table. Once I understood the issue from the Stack overflow explanation is was simple to move the h3 above the table head to correct the problem.

The remainder of the code is my own work
