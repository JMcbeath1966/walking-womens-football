                    <h2>Playing - The Basic Rules!</h2>
                    <form>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We have our own simplified set of rules that we use for games and friendly sessions. <br>They are broadly the same as those used by the FA (Football Association) in games across England.<a class="rules-link" href="https://www.walkingfootball.co.uk/walking-football-rules/">&nbsp;Full rules here!</a></li>
                        </ul>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Walking only at all times when the ball is in play. Players may not run or jog, with or without the ball.</li>
                                <li>Players may not head the ball.</li>
                                <li>Low impact tackling and physical contact only is permitted. No sliding tackles. No tackling whilst on the ground. No tackling between or around the legs from behind.</li>
                                <li>The ball must not pass above head height. A free kick is awarded to the opposing team if the ball is kicked or deflected above head height. An exception to this rule is a deflection off a goalkeeper, in which case the goalkeeper is given possession of the ball.</li>
                                <li>"Throw-ins" must be kicked in.</li>
                                <li>Opposing players must stand at least 3 meters away from the ball when a corner, free-kick, kick-in or kick-off is taken.</li>
                                <li>Goals cannot be scored direct from free-kicks, kick-offs, kick-ins or drop-balls.</li>
                                <li>Players are not allowed in the penalty area, (however see rule 13 below). If a defender enters in the penalty area deliberately a penalty is awarded to the attacking team. If an attacking player enteres the penalty area deliberately ball possession is given to the defending goalkeeper.</li>
                                <li>If a free kick is awarded to the attacking team within 3 metres of the penalty area the position of the free-kick is moved back to allow defenders to position themselves between the ball and goal.</li>
                                <li>The goalkeeper may distribute the ball by kicking or throwing, throws must be under-arm.</li>
                                <li>The goalkeeper can receive a back pass, but he/she may not pick up a back pass, and on receiving a back pass must distribute the ball by foot.</li>
                                <li>When taking a penalty, a player may take a maximum of two steps before striking the ball.</l>
                            </ol>
                            <h2>Playing - Things to consider!</h2>
                                <p class="considerations">Following the sucess of Englands women football team, womens football is enjoying an exponential uptake for women of all ages joining the game. There has never been a better time for you to play and enjoy the sport!</p>
                                <p class="considerations">Very different to the regular game of football, walking football caters primarily for the over 40s, although some tournaments are now running for players exclusively in their 60s and 70s.</p>
                                <p class="considerations">Walking football is played at a much slower pace allowing many players who have loved the game throughout their lives to continue playing albeit at a gentler rate, and at the same time encourages players new to the game to take part knowing that the threat of any injury is dramatically reduced.</p>
                                <p class="considerations">We do recommend players wear 'breathable' clothing if possible, but anything they feel comfortable in is fine. A shirt or short designed specifically for sports allows body heat to be expelled and air to circulate better around the body, keeping players cool and preventing overheating.</p>
                                <p class="considerations">It doesn't have to be expensive if you want to invest in kits. The only thing you may need to buy that you donâ€™t already own is a pair of shin pads and perhaps some appropriate footwear.</p> 
                                <p class="considerations">Walking Football can be played in any kind of training shoe, but 'football-specific' trainers will give you more stability and better ball control. The venue may specify what types of footwear are allowed/not allowed. You are advised to contact the club/sports centre before attending.</p>   
                                <p class="considerations">However, if you begin to play Walking Football competitively, you will need to wear the appropriate kit.</p>
                                <p class="considerations">We recommend:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Surface appropriate trainers or boots</li>
                                <li>A breathable shirt</li>
                                <li>Breathable shorts</li>
                                <li>Shin Pads</li>
                                <li>Hat, cap and gloves - as appropriate for the weather</li>
