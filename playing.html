                    <h2>Playing - The Basic Rules!</h2>
                <form>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have our own simplified set of rules that we use for games and friendly sessions. <br>They are broadly the same as those used by the FA (Football Association) in games across England.<a href="https://www.walkingfootball.co.uk/walking-football-rules/">Full rules here!</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Walking only at all times when the ball is in play. Players may not run or jog, with or without the ball.</li>
                        <li>Players may not head the ball.</li>
                        <li>Low impact tackling and physical contact only is permitted. No sliding tackles. No tackling whilst on the ground. No tackling between or around the legs from behind.</li>
                        <li>The ball must not pass above head height. A free kick is awarded to the opposing team if the ball is kicked or deflected above head height. An exception to this rule is a deflection off a goalkeeper, in which case the goalkeeper is given possession of the ball.</li>
                        <li>"Throw-ins" must be kicked in.</li>
                        <li>Opposing players must stand at least 3 meters away from the ball when a corner, free-kick, kick-in or kick-off is taken.</li>
                        <li>Goals cannot be scored direct from free-kicks, kick-offs, kick-ins or drop-balls.</li>
                        <li>Players are not allowed in the penalty area, (however see rule 13 below). If a defender enters in the penalty area deliberately a penalty is awarded to the attacking team. If an attacking player enteres the penalty area deliberately ball possession is given to the defending goalkeeper.</li>
                        <li>If a free kick is awarded to the attacking team within 3 metres of the penalty area the position of the free-kick is moved back to allow defenders to position themselves between the ball and goal.</li>
                        <li>The goalkeeper may distribute the ball by kicking or throwing, throws must be under-arm.</li>
                        <li>The goalkeeper can receive a back pass, but he/she may not pick up a back pass, and on receiving a back pass must distribute the ball by foot.</li>
                        <li>When taking a penalty, a player may take a maximum of two steps before striking the ball.</l>

            <h2>Playing - Things to consider!</h2>
            <p>Very different to the regular game of football, walking football caters primarily for the over 50s, although some tournaments are now running for players exclusively in their 60’s and 70’s.
            <p>Walking football is played at a much slower pace allowing many players who have loved the game throughout their lives to continue playing albeit at a gentler rate, and at the same time encourages players new to the game to take part knowing that the threat of any injury is dramatically reduced.</p>
            <p>The positive benefits of participating in walking football include increasing your cardiovascular health, your postural balance and resting heart rate as well as improving your mental wellbeing by achieving the feeling of satisfaction and personal reward.<p>
